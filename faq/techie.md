As a techie, you should care about NOIS because it provides a secure and reliable way to incorporate randomness into your dapps. Randomness is often essential for creating fair and unpredictable outcomes in games, lotteries, and other applications. NOIS uses the drand protocol to generate randomness and makes it available to dapps via IBC, providing a simple and cost-effective solution for incorporating randomness into your projects. Additionally, NOIS provides a toolbox for dapp developers, allowing you to easily integrate NOIS into your dapps and transform the randomness you receive in a safe and standardised manner. This can help you to create more engaging and secure dapps for your users.
