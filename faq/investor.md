#### Why should I care about nois as an investor?

As an investor, you should care about NOIS because it is an important component of the growing Cosmos ecosystem. By providing a secure and reliable source of randomness, NOIS enables the development of a wide range of decentralized applications (dapps) that can benefit from randomly generated data. This can help to drive adoption and growth in the Cosmos ecosystem, potentially leading to increased value for investors. Additionally, as a decentralized and permissionless network, NOIS offers the potential for investors to participate in its governance and potentially earn rewards for supporting the network.

#### Wen airdrop ser?

An investor walks into a bar and asks the bartender if he's heard of NOIS. The bartender replies, "Yeah, I've heard of it. It's a blockchain project that provides randomness to other chains through IBC." The investor then excitedly asks, "Do they do airdrops?" The bartender laughs and says, "No, I don't think they do airdrops. That's not really their focus. They're more interested in providing secure and unbiased randomness for dapps." The investor pouts and says, "Well, that's no fun. I was hoping to get some free tokens." The bartender shakes his head and says, "Sorry, buddy. You'll have to look elsewhere for your free money... Oh wait you look like a random dude... if you are random enough you might be eligible to get one."
