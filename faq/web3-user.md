#### why should I care about nois as an end user?

As an end user, you should care about NOIS because it helps to ensure the fairness and unpredictability of the dapps you use. For example, if you use a lottery or gaming dapp that incorporates randomness generated by NOIS, you can be confident that the outcomes are truly random and not susceptible to manipulation. This can help to ensure that the dapps you use are fair and trustworthy, providing a better experience for you as a user. Additionally, the use of NOIS can help to improve the security of dapps by providing a secure and reliable source of randomness, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities and attacks.
