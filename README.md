Nois is a Proof of Stake blockchain protocol that allows developers to use secure, unbiased and cost efficient randomness via IBC

Inside this documentation you will find all the instructions in order to:

* Setup a full node and become a Nois validator earning $NOIS while sustaining the chain.
* Fix common validators/full-node problems.
* Use Nois to bring randomness into your decentralised application.
