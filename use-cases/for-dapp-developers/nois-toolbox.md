# ðŸ“¦ Nois Toolbox

Next to providing the randomness, Nois provides a set of tooling to help developers reshape the received randomness in order to apply it to their custom use case.

The toolbox is available in this github repository [https://github.com/noislabs/nois](https://github.com/noislabs/nois) and two artefacts are published. \
\- rust crate: [https://crates.io/crates/nois](https://crates.io/crates/nois)\
